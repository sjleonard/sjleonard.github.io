# Mechanisms of maintenance of species diversity

- What is diversity maintenance? "coexistenc in the same spatial region of species having similar ecology," including overlapping resource requirments
  - Alternatively, to general maintenance of species richness and evenness, but not the focus here 
  - The area under study should be large enough such that pop. dynamics are not greatly affected by migration  

## Stable Coexistence

- Stable coexistence means densities of species show no long-term trends (i.e., if densities are low, species generally recover)
- Unstable coexistence means species may not recover and may die out
- We can express stable coexistence in rough quantiativ terms using the invasiability critierion (i.e., that each species can increase from low density in the presence of the rest of the community
  - species must have positive long-term low-density growth rates, $$\bar{r}_i$$

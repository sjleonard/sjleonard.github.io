# Mechanisms of maintenance of species diversity

- What is diversity maintenance? "coexistenc in the same spatial region of species having similar ecology," including overlapping resource requirments
  - Alternatively, to general maintenance of species richness and evenness, but not the focus here 
  - The area under study should be large enough such that pop. dynamics are not greatly affected by migration  

## Stable Coexistence

- Stable coexistence means densities of species show no long-term trends (i.e., if densities are low, species generally recover)
- Unstable coexistence means species may not recover and may die out
- We can express stable coexistence in rough quantiativ terms using the invasiability critierion (i.e., that each species can increase from low density in the presence of the rest of the community
  - Species must have positive long-term low-density growth rates, $$\bar{r}_i$$ 
  - What is necssary for $$\bar{r}_i > 0$$?
    - Species must be distinguished in ecologically significant ways -- but what is ecologically significant? 
- Consider Lotka-Volterra compeition: \begin{align}  
\frac{1}{N_i} \cdot \frac{d N_i}{dt} = r_i (1 - \alpha_{ii} N_i - \alpha_{i j} N_j), \ \ \ i = 1, 2, \ j \neq i.
\end{align}
  - Here, we see that

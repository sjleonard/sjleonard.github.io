# Chapter 1. Biodiversity and Plant-Animal Coevolution

- People have been studying plant-animal mutualisms since the mid 19th century
  - Darwin was interested in plant-animal interactions, even predicted secondary extinctions
- de Bary (1879) coined the term *symbiosis*
- But antagonistic interactions like predation and competition (emphasized by e.g., Clements and Tansley) were more central in ecology 
  - Also in Lotka-Volterra models, even though Gause and Witt (1935) proposed similar mutualistic models

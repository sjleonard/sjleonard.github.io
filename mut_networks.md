## Historical overview <a name="1.1"></a>

- People have been studying plant-animal mutualisms since the mid 19th century
  - Darwin was interested in plant-animal interactions, even predicted secondary extinctions
- de Bary (1879) coined the term *symbiosis*
- But antagonistic interactions like predation and competition (emphasized by e.g., Clements and Tansley) were more central in ecology 
  - Also in Lotka-Volterra models, even though Gause and Witt (1935) proposed similar mutualistic models
- Reasons why mutualisms may not have been more widely studied:
  - Difficult to find stable solutions to dynamic models of mutualism
  - Lack of empirical tools and theory made synthesis difficult
  - Stigmatized due to association with anarchism
- Ehrlich and Raven's (1964) paper on coevolution reignited interest
- Mutualisms are old and very functionally important
  - Pollination is at least 200 million years old, common by 100 m.y.a.
  - Pollination and seed dispersal are critical for the functioning of ecosystems
    - But are threatened by anthropogenic pressures like hunting and habitat loss
    - Large seed dispersers are going extinct at an especially high rate
    - In the geological record, insect extinction or decline is often followed by extinction of flowering plants
- Study of mutualistic interactions has shifted from early focus on one-to-one interactions to greater incorporation of community context
  - Recent recognition that generalism is widespread (Chittka et al., 1996)

## A bit of natural history <a name="1.2"></a>

- Mutualisms are among the mst common interactions in terrestrial communities (Janzen, 1985)
- Major groups of mutualistic interactions (though focus of this book is first two):
    - Pollination
    - Seed dispersal among animals and plants
    - Protective mutualisms among ants and plants
    - Harvest mutualisms
    - Humans and other organisms (e.g., agriculture, husbandry)
- Most mutualisms likely lie somewhere on gradient of effectiveness from antagonism towards legitimate mutualism
- Seed dispersal is not a harvest mutualism because fitness of mother also increases as a result of mutualism
- An efficient disperser (1) efficiently consumes seeds and (2) spreads seeds far from mother plant (where successful germination and establishment is more likely)
    - Especially with frugivory, though, there is usually seasonality, so frugivores need diversified diets
        - Plant-frugivore mutalisms typicaly show low specificity (Jordano, 1987)
- Alternatively, pollination tends to benefit from high specificity of interactions
    - Pollen should be carried to conspecific flowers
    - Pollinators don't necessarily need as diverse diets
    - Flowers also tend to signal receptivity to pollination (e.g., by color and odor) more than plants with seeds

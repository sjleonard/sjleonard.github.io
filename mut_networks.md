# Chapter 1. Biodiversity and Plant-Animal Coevolution <a name="1"></a>

## Historical overview <a name="1.1"></a>

- People have been studying plant-animal mutualisms since the mid 19th century
  - Darwin was interested in plant-animal interactions, even predicted secondary extinctions
- de Bary (1879) coined the term *symbiosis*
- But antagonistic interactions like predation and competition (emphasized by e.g., Clements and Tansley) were more central in ecology 
  - Also in Lotka-Volterra models, even though Gause and Witt (1935) proposed similar mutualistic models
- Reasons why mutualisms may not have been more widely studied:
  - Difficult to find stable solutions to dynamic models of mutualism
  - Lack of empirical tools and theory made synthesis difficult
  - Stigmatized due to association with anarchism
- Ehrlich and Raven's (1964) paper on coevolution reignited interest
- Mutualisms are old and very functionally important
  - Pollination is at least 200 million years old, common by 100 m.y.a.
  - Pollination and seed dispersal are critical for the functioning of ecosystems
    - But are threatened by anthropogenic pressures like hunting and habitat loss
    - Large seed dispersers are going extinct at an especially high rate
    - In the geological record, insect extinction or decline is often followed by extinction of flowering plants
- Study of mutualistic interactions has shifted from early focus on one-to-one interactions to greater incorporation of community context
  - Recent recognition that generalism is widespread (Chittka et al., 1996)

## A bit of natural history <a name="1.2"></a>

- Mutualisms are among the mst common interactions in terrestrial communities (Janzen, 1985)
- Major groups of mutualistic interactions (though focus of this book is first two):
    - Pollination
    - Seed dispersal among animals and plants
    - Protective mutualisms among ants and plants
    - Harvest mutualisms
    - Humans and other organisms (e.g., agriculture, husbandry)
- Most mutualisms likely lie somewhere on gradient of effectiveness from antagonism towards legitimate mutualism
- Seed dispersal is not a harvest mutualism because fitness of mother also increases as a result of mutualism
- An efficient disperser (1) efficiently consumes seeds and (2) spreads seeds far from mother plant (where successful germination and establishment is more likely)
    - Especially with frugivory, though, there is usually seasonality, so frugivores need diversified diets
        - Plant-frugivore mutalisms typicaly show low specificity (Jordano, 1987)  
- Alternatively, pollination tends to benefit from high specificity of interactions
    - Pollen should be carried to conspecific flowers
    - Pollinators don't necessarily need as diverse diets
    - Flowers also tend to signal receptivity to pollination (e.g., by color and odor) more than plants with seeds

## Coevolution in multispecific mutualisms <a name="1.3"></a>

- Coevolution involves joint evolutionary trajectoris of separate gene pools that do not mix
- Coevolution is one of the results of plant-animal mutualisms
- Most multipcific interactions are diversified, but it's hard to predict the effects of coevolution on a newtork of hundreds of interacting species - "diffuse coevolution"
- However, a big advance has been John Thompson's idea of "geographic mosaics of coevolution"
    - Most mutualisms have both spatial and temporal variability and seem context-dependent
    - Thompson's idea has three main premises  
    (1) Interactions occur among species distributed in populations  
    (2) Outcomes of interactions vary across populations  
    (3) Interacting species do not necessarily have matching geographic ranges  
    - These premises produce predictions:  
    (1) There is mosaic of selection across populations, leading to different evolutionary trajectories  
    (2) There may only be coevolution occurring in some populations (coevolutionary hotspots)  
    (3) There will be remixing of traits due to gene flow, drift, and local extinctions  
- The next step is to extend from multispecific systems to whole networks, which is what this book is about
    - To do this, we need network theory  


# Chapter 2. An Introduction to Complex Networks <a name="2"></a>

## A network approach to complex systems <a name="2.1"></a>

- A network (or graph) is a set of vertices (or nodes) connected by edges (or links), i.e., a pair $(G,V)$
    - A graph is a mathematical object, but can be used in science to represent relationships between objects
        - e.g., genes linked by gene regulation, proteins interacting to create structure, species in a food web, etc.
